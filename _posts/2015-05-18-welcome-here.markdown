[Working Copy] is a Git client for iOS that I started work on in the summer of 2014 shortly
after [WWDC].

It seemed the [file-provider extensions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/#234-video) 
introduced in iOS 8 would open up what could be done on iPhone and iPad and Git looked like something 
that fit perfectly on a mobile device. 

If you do any sort of work with Git you should [download][iTunes] my application which is free on 
the App Store.
